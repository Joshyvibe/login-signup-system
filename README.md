# login-signup-system
A django login/signup web app using sqlite3
For this website to work on your system, I will assume you have knowlegde of django and you understands how it works.

For the login-signup-system to work you must:
1. pip install django on your work environment
2. pip install django-crispy-forms..

Also note this login-signup-system comes with email registration confirmation server which will work if you set up your email properly and also have your server running correctly.
The email confirmation server is a bonus modification but it requires you to know how to use it for it to work efficiently with your email.
